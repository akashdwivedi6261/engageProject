## Technology we used:
HTML and CSS: Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Style Sheets are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the layout, for a variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications. Web developers use HTML keywords or tags to instruct the Web browser application on how to format and display the content of Web pages.
## Challenges we faced: 
we all are new to Github and javascript so understanding the concepts and applying them immediately is one of the major challenges. we have to connect 2â€“3 times a day to meet for a discussion and track the project's progress.
## Our Workflow:
First, we shared our responsibility in the project, initiated the GitHub repository, and worked on our respective branches. we used to connect daily if there is any problem Finally, we merge each branch to the master branch. So, we were successful in replicating Clone of engagebay website. It was knowledgeable as well as a bit challenging, we learned a lot of new things while building and working as a team.
